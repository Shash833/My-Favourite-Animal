                   <p> "Sharks are a large group of fish that have inhabited the oceans for over 400 million years, even before dinosaurs populated our planet. 
                       <br>They belong to the superorder Selachimorpha, and modern sharks have specific characteristics like a cartilaginous skeleton, five or six pairs of gills and several rows of teeth."

                <p> "Sharks are found from shallow to deep sea environments, in coastal, marine and oceanic environments the world over. 
                    <br>Some species inhabit shallow, coastal regions, while others live in deep waters, on the ocean floor and in the open ocean. 
                    <br>A few species, such as the bull shark, move easily through salt, fresh and brackish waters."
